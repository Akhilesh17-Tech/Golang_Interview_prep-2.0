docker networking 
Networking is a crucial aspect of computer science, and it's essential to understand the basics of networking to
become proficient in computer science. Here are some key concepts to get you started:   
1.  **Network Topology**: This refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices on a network. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, and mesh.

how to reduce docker container size ?
Docker containers can be quite large, especially if you're using a lot of dependencies or libraries.
Here are some tips to reduce the size of your Docker container:
1.  **Use a smaller base image**: Choose a smaller base image to start with. For example, you can use an official image like `alpine` instead of `ubuntu`.
2.  **Remove unnecessary packages**: Remove any unnecessary packages or dependencies from your Dockerfile.
3.  **Use multi-stage builds**: Use multi-stage builds to separate your build process from your runtime environment. This can help reduce the size of your final image.
4.  **Use a smaller package manager**: Use a smaller package manager like `apk` instead of `apt-get`.
5.  **Use a Dockerfile with a smaller size**: Use a Dockerfile with a smaller size by removing unnecessary commands and instructions.
6.  **Use a smaller runtime environment**: Use a smaller runtime environment like `node:alpine` instead of `node:latest`.
7.  **Use a Docker image with a smaller size**: Use a Docker image with a smaller size like `nginx:alpine` instead of `nginx:latest`.
8.  **Use a Docker image with a smaller size**: Use a Docker image with a smaller size like `mysql:5.7` instead of `mysql:latest`.

how to secure container ?
Securing containers is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Here are some best practices to secure
your containers:

1.  **Use a secure base image**: Choose a secure base image that has been vetted
2.  **Use a secure networking model**: Use a secure networking model like Docker's built-in
3.  **Use a secure authentication mechanism**: Use a secure authentication mechanism like 
4.  **Use a secure authorization mechanism**: Use a secure authorization mechanism like
5.  **Use a secure logging mechanism**: Use a secure logging mechanism like
6.  **Use a secure monitoring mechanism**: Use a secure monitoring mechanism like
7.  **Use a secure backup mechanism**: Use a secure backup mechanism like
8.  **Use a secure update mechanism**: Use a secure update mechanism like
9.  **Use a secure configuration mechanism**: Use a secure configuration mechanism like
10. **Use a secure secrets management mechanism**: Use a secure secrets management mechanism like
